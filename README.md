## MIPS
### Brief
This project - first assignment of Computer Organization course - aims to implement JALR, BNE, LBU and SLLV instructions in Monocycle, Multicycle and Pipeline version of MIPS through logisim simulator.

### Doc
The doc, all written in Poruguese, was attached [here](MIPS%20-%20G1.pdf).

### Implementation
The MIPS Monocycle can be found in [MIPS_Monociclo.circ](MIPS_Monociclo.circ). <br>
The Multicycle can be found in [MIPS_Multiciclo.circ](MIPS_Multiciclo.circ). <br>
The Multicycle can be found in [MIPS_Pipeline_2017.circ](MIPS_Pipeline_2017.circ).
