## MIPS
### Brief
This project - first assignment of Computer Organization course - aims to implement JALR, BNE, LBU and SLLV instructions in Monocycle, Multicycle and Pipeline versions of MIPS through logisim simulator. The basic instructions such as LW, SW, ADD, SUB and BEQ were already implement in those three organization.

### Doc
The doc, all written in Poruguese, was attached [here](MIPS%20-%20G1.pdf).

### Implementation
The MIPS Monocycle can be found in [MIPS_Monociclo.circ](MIPS_Monociclo.circ). <br>
The Multicycle can be found in [MIPS_Multiciclo.circ](MIPS_Multiciclo.circ). <br>
The Multicycle can be found in [MIPS_Pipeline_2017.circ](MIPS_Pipeline_2017.circ).
